* `load_images.py`: Loads behavioral data as well as images collected for widefield imaging. It has different functions: One can load specific images, see the stimuli presented over time and frames taken along, analyze the images of baseline, evoked and change in activity. At the end, there's a function that splits between even/odd trials to verify the reliability of the data.
* `calcium_sessions_analysis.py`: Visualization of the evoked, baseline and signal change images for 1 session.
* `multiple_sessions_analysis.py`: Visualization of the signal change images for the 3 frequencies for multiple recording sessions.
* `dynamics01.py`: Analysis of the change in activity over time for 1 session in a specific area of pixels.
* `wifi008_info_widefield.py`: First version of info file for widefield imaging sessions.
