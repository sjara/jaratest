    * `load_data`:description
    * `collect_behavior_data`: description
    * `collect_events`: description
    * `filter_and_group`: description

### Plotting 📊

* `plot_for_analysis.py`: Contains functions for plotting graphs useful for data analysis from coop_four_ports paradigm.  
    * `pct_rewarded_trials` : Show  percentage of rewarded trials for each barrier per pair of mice in a categorical scatter graph. 
    * `plot_accum_rewards`: Show accumulated rewarded trials for each barrier per pair of mice in a barplot.
    * `violin_plot_waitTime`: It helps us analyse the wait time parameter of coop_four_ports paradigm by computing how much time passed between the first and the second poke and plotting the data in a violin plot.
